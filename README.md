# hsmith
hsmith is a random program generator for C. 
It was developed in the hopes of replacing CSmith in a research project at 
ETH Zeurich. 

Instead however, it now represents a case of "when not to use Haskell". 
The reasoning for this is quite simple, there were just too many edge cases and 
there was a requirement to break out of purity. Functional Programming is great 
and is mostly applicable everywhere but the keyword here is **mostly**.
